# Handsome Score — Pro Edition

This is the professional version: evidence-based scoring (symmetry + golden ratio + smile + eyes) with an ego-friendly mapping so great results (90%+) are achievable for well-proportioned faces.

## Quick run

1. Unzip the project folder.
2. Open terminal in the project folder (where package.json is).
3. Run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```
4. Open the Local URL (http://localhost:5173) or Network URL shown by Vite to test on phone (same Wi-Fi).

## Deploy

Push to GitHub then deploy on Vercel (Import project) — framework: Vite, build: `npm run build`, output: `dist`.

## Notes

- Images are processed locally in the browser (privacy-first).
- Tweak weights in `src/App.jsx` in the `raw` composition line if you want different emphasis.
